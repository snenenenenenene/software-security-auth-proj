# SoftwareSecurity

## Summary

This is the final project for the course Software Security.
For said course we had to create a web application that introduces a self-made authentic login and registering mechanism.
The registering mechanism disables users to check in with a vulnerable password by chcking the **HIBP** (Have I been Pwned) API. 

After a user has been registered, aforementioned user will be able to use his credentials to log in to the web application.
After doing so, the user will be greeted by the homepage of the website wich is frankly quite lackluster, but it was not part of the requirements nor the scope of our project.
